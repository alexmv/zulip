# In the ordering of operations below, the crucial detail is that
# Django, Tornado, and workers need to be restarted before reloading
# nginx. Django and Tornado have in-memory maps of which realm belongs
# to which shard. Reloading nginx will cause users' tornado requests
# to be routed according to the new sharding scheme. If that happens
# before Django is restarted, updating its realm->shard map, users on
# realms whose shard has changed will have their tornado requests
# handled by the new tornado process, while Django will still use the
# old process for its internal communication with tornado when
# servicing the user's requests.  That's a bad state that leads to
# clients getting into reload loops ending in crashing on 500 response
# while Django is restarting.  For this reason it's important to
# reload nginx only after Django and Tornado.
